Using ThetaCloud's Arduino library
==================================

If the development environment is already set up in a way that allows for
:any:`flashing own programs <flashing>` on the main ThetaCloud boards and
the :ref:`library is installed and ready to use in Arduino <installing>`,
it's time to write a first program using Arduino IDE that would make
a ThetaCloud board do something useful in the
:doc:`first part of the tutorial <library-tutorial/01-simplest-application>`.
