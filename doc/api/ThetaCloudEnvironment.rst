ThetaCloudEnvironment
=====================

.. cpp:class:: ThetaCloudEnvironment

	ThetaCloudEnvironment is an optional, external board equipped with
	``MICS-VZ-89F`` and `MPL3115A2`` sensors, allowing it to detect CO2, VOC, altitude, temperature and pressure.

	:Publishes:
		:co2:
			Current level of CO2 as detected by ``MICS-VZ-89F``.

			:units:	``[ppm]``
			:format: ``float``

		:voc:
			Current level of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), as detected by
			``MICS-VZ-89F``.

			:units:	``[ppb]``
			:format: ``float``

		.. note::
			Following readings may not always be available. See :ref:`mpl3115A2`.

		:altitude:
			Detected altitude.

			:units:	``[m]``
			:format:	``float``

		:pressure:
			Pressure.

			:units:	``[Pa]``
			:format: ``float``

		:envTemp:
			Temperature detected by the extension board.

			:units:	``[C]``
			:format: ``float``

	:Consumes: This module does not consume any data.

.. _MPL3115A2:

Optional usage of MPL3115A2 sensor
----------------------------------

If the `Adafruit MPL3115A2 Library <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MPL3115A2_Library>`_
is present, board can provide additional readings of Altitude, Pressure and Temperature.
To enable this functionality:

#. Install the Adafruit MPL3115A2 Library in Arduino IDE,
#. Uncomment the ``USE_MPL3115A2`` feature flag in ``ThetaCloudEnvironment.h``.
